# DirScanner
Tools used to scan and save directory hierarchy and view it separately in a tree view.

This set of tool can be used in a scenario in which you need someone to present their directory hierarchy to you, but there is no methods that can view directories available, such as FTP. You can let the remote person run the DirScanner and send the FileScanResult to you, then you can use DirScanViewer to read it (or just read the file). Also you can use the tools to record your directories as you like.

## DirScanner
A CLI application. No necessary and available command-line arguments. Copy it into the root folder of desirable directory tree and then run it to scan the hierarchy from this root. A file named FileScanResult will appear, which is text-based and readable.

## DirScanViewer
A GUI application. Used to read the FileScanResult generated by DirScanner. It will present the recorded hierarchy in a tree view control.

## About Legacy Version
Since timestamp function has been added to current version (in this master branch), the FileScanResult generated by legacy version is not compatible with this version's DirScanViewer. Also the previous Viewer cannot read FileScanResult which is generated by this version's Scanner.
